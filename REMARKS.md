# Errors and warnings
These are just some remarks recording the log file.
- Event data for meshcore_raw_event exceed maximum size of 32768 bytes; nothing to do with these solutions but if your number of contacts grows above 100 you migh get this warning (if you snif the raw contacts you see this one is huge)
- piping to int; it is very recommended to included a default, mostly zero which become "int(0)" but any suitable value is possible (tried to update my examples but maybe missed one)
-
